<p>Welcome to Michael O'Sullivan's Clone of the Classic Arcade Game Frogger. In order to play this game please <a href="http://michaelosullivan.london/projects/jsgame/" target="_blank">click here</a> to load the game. Once loaded select your characters via the keypad on your keyboard (the arrows). Once you have selected your character the purpose of the game is to get to collect as many ruby's and Gems as possible, but becareful, the insects will eat you if you are on the same square as them at the same time.</p>

<p>See if you can collect more points than all your friends!</p>
